## Introduction

AI Cosmo aims to be a versatile and powerful platform leveraging state-of-the-art AI models. It provides users and businesses with tools for content creation, interactive communication, and exploring AI capabilities through a user-friendly interface.

## Core AI Features

AI Cosmo offers a suite of AI-driven functionalities:

*   **ü§ñ Text Generation:** Generate human-like text based on prompts or given context using various language models.
*   **üñºÔ∏è Text-to-Image Conversion:** Create unique images from textual descriptions.
*   **üó£Ô∏è Voice Chat:** Engage in real-time voice conversations with AI agents.
*   **üé• Video Chat:** Interact with AI through real-time video sessions (details TBD based on model capabilities).
*   **ü§ù AI vs. AI Interaction:** Enable scenarios where two AI models interact (e.g., debates, collaborative tasks).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Model Customization:** Allow users to select from different available AI models based on their specific needs and subscription plan.

## User Roles & Permissions

The platform defines distinct roles to manage access and functionality:

1.  **üë§ User:**
    *   Create and manage their account.
    *   Subscribe to different usage plans (e.g., Free, Premium, Enterprise).
    *   Access and utilize AI models according to their subscribed plan.
    *   Contact customer support for assistance or issue reporting.

2.  **üõ†Ô∏è Support Staff:**
    *   Manage user support tickets (create, track, resolve).
    *   Provide real-time assistance via live chat.
    *   Generate reports on technical issues and user feedback.

3.  **üëë Administrator:**
    *   Full user account management (create, modify, delete).
    *   Monitor platform usage, activity logs, and AI model performance.
    *   Manage subscription plans (create, modify pricing and features).

## Technology Stack

AI Cosmo is built using the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   `HTML5`: Structure and content.
    *   `Tailwind CSS`: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.
    *   `JavaScript`: Client-side interactivity and API communication.
*   **Backend:**
    *   `Laravel (PHP)`: Core backend framework for business logic, API development, and data management.
    *   `Express.js (Node.js)`: *(Optional)* Potentially used for specific microservices or real-time features (e.g., WebSockets).
*   **Database:**
    *   `MySQL` / `PostgreSQL`: Relational database for storing user data, plans, logs, etc.
*   **Development & Deployment Tools:**
    *   `Git`: Version control system.
    *   `Docker`: *(Optional)* Containerization for easier development setup and deployment consistency.

## Design & User Experience (UX) Principles

The platform prioritizes a high-quality user experience:

*   **‚ú® Intuitive Interface:** Clean, simple, and easy-to-navigate design.
*   **üé® Customization:** Options for users to personalize their interface appearance (where feasible).
*   **‚ôø Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities.

## Getting Started

These instructions are preliminary and will be updated as the project progresses.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Git
*   PHP (specific version for Laravel) & Composer
*   Node.js & npm/yarn (if using JS frameworks or Express.js)
*   MySQL or PostgreSQL Database Server
*   Docker (Optional, if used)

**Installation Steps (Example):**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cosmo.git
    cd ai-cosmo
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies (Laravel):**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Configure database credentials, API keys (for AI models), and other settings in the `.env` file.
5.  **Database Migration:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed # (if seeders are available)
    ```
6.  **Generate Application Key (Laravel):**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
7.  **Build Frontend Assets (if necessary):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or build for production
    ```
8.  **Run the development server (Laravel):**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    *(If using Express.js separately, run its server as well)*

## Project Structure & Deliverables

The project aims for high-quality deliverables as outlined in the specifications:

*   **Source Code:** Clean, well-documented, modular, and following best practices.
*   **Documentation:** Includes this README, technical documentation within the code (comments, docblocks), and potentially separate docs for APIs or architecture.
*   **Diagrams:** Project artifacts like UML diagrams, Use Case diagrams, and Class diagrams will be maintained (potentially in a `/docs` or `/design` folder) to illustrate the system's architecture and interactions.
